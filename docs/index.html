            <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Homeland Security/Defense</h3>
                    <p> <br> With the rise in cyber operations & data warfare, I would like to be part of modernizing the way that we defend our homeland. I believe that furthering our utilization of data will allow for more tactical defense strategies. I am interested in exploring ethical tracking strategies & reenforcing effective data collection techniques.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Technology Consulting</h3>
                    <p> <br> In order to maintain a competitive edge, many companies are shifting to more modern data & customer interaction techniques that often involve cutting edge technology. However, it is nearly impossible to keep up with the optimal strategies, and it is even more difficult to determine when a new technology is worth the resource investment. I would like to provide evidence-based strategies to interested organizations on how technologies like ML, cloud computing, Internet of Things, etc. would benefit or harm their organizations.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Federal/State Population Research/Data Management</h3>
                    <p> Similarly to my interests with homeland security, I believe that there is more potential in the data we publicly collect than what we are currently using it for. Security & defense measures aren't the only applications. I would like to use data analysis techniques to provide objective explanations/analyses for some of the most pressing issues in our society.</p>

            <h2>My Research Experience</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>OSS Volunteer Engagement</h3>
                    <p>Spring 2024 - For a semester, I worked with the UMass Public Policy department to explore & visualize the relationship between volunteer sabbaticals & success in the Apache incubator program for open source software projects. This project was a continuation of previous studies looking at different factors affecting volunteer retention in OSS incubating projects. We used commit records as our representation of activity & the Bayesian change-point R package to highlight significant changes in that work activity. Based on our visualizations & statistical tests, this definition of sabbaticals's presence is not strongly correlated with success in the apache incubator program. Further exploration will include using email records to define which dips & returns in productivity were intentional sabbaticals & which were undefined breaks to decrease the noise in our data. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Forward Mode Automatic Differentiation</h3>
                    <p>Summer 2024 - As a part of the UMass CICS URV program, I had the opportunity to work with Kunjal Panchal (PhD canidate) & a team to research, profile, & appraise the new PyTorch Forward Mode Automatic Differentiation Beta version. We used Google Collab's GPUs to train the regular-sized BERT model using the new Beta version of the FW AD, the old Alpha version of the FW AD, and the standard reverse mode ad so that the changes could be compared for their effectiveness. We profiled the memory usage of each auto diff method, tracked the accuracy, & determined the convergence time. Our conclusions were that there were significant improvements in both accuracy & memory usage between the alpha & the beta versions, but both models still perform worse than the backprop option. Further testing could include using a smaller model with less parameters for testing.</p>
